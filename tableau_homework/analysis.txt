Phenomenon 1: The first week of the month had a signifigantly lower amount of users than the rest of the period. 
This is shown by subscibers only taking 100,000 trips during the first week and then 459,000 the following week.
This higher amount of users during the laters weeks shows that the subscribers are not travelling as far as the 
customers, as the average trip duration drops once the number of subscribers increases.


Phenomenon 2: Males are traveling by bike at a much higher amount than women. Despite similar average age between
 the genders, women are traveling an extra 3minutes per average

Map trends: Majority of the most visits stations were on the west of the main island, close to the river.
Stations to the north were alternatively quite low in visitation as well as in the far south areas. It can be 
assumed that a majority of bike users live in or begin their journey closer to the middle of the city.
